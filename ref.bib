  abstract  = "We have built a virtual-reality simulator to design quadrotor
               robots that increase the independence of elderly persons living
               alone. The simulator lets us measure under what conditions a
               robot makes someone feel intrigued, or alarmed, or unconcerned,
               extending to nonhumanoids the studies of emotion that have been
               done for robots with facial expressions. This better model of
               how the virtual robot is perceived lets us agilely improve its
               appearance and behavior, containing the combinatorial explosion
               of parameters to study in costlier real-world experiments. The
               residence and the robot are rendered with Unity, and viewed with
               an Oculus Rift. Audio corresponding to flight maneuvers is
               resynthesized from recordings of an actual quadrotor. Flight
               dynamics using L1 adaptive control run in MATLAB and Simulink.
               Through menus operated by a Leap Motion hand tracker, the human
               subject commands the quadrotor to fly to various rooms (Unity
               waypoints), along precomputed paths that avoid collisions. The
               flight path is varied through a mathematical mapping to Laban
               Motion Factors (e.g., directness, sustainedness, lightness, and
               boundness) to provoke a range of responses. The subject's
               emotion is estimated from heart rate, skin conductance, and head
               tilt from the Rift's IMU (which is a quick metric for discomfort
               level).",
