% The title (name) with a horizontal rule under it

% The section headings
%
% Usage: \section{section name}
%
% Follow this section IMMEDIATELY with the first line of the section
% text. Do not put whitespace in between. That is, do this:
%
%       \section{My Information}
%       Here is my information.
%
% and NOT this:
%
%       \section{My Information}
%
%       Here is my information.
%
% Otherwise the top of the section header will not line up with the top
% of the section. Of course, using a single comment character (%) on
% empty lines allows for the function of the first example with the
% readability of the second example.

\section{Technical Summary}
Proficiency of programming languages (from most to least comfortable): Julia, \CPP, C, Python, Simulink. Extensive experience with robotics development on quadrotors and ground robots - typically this would involve a \CPP/C firmware stack, ROS/LCM communication middleware, and a Julia/Python/Simulink layer that handles the high-level decision making. The following are some of the open-source packages published on Github:\\\medskip

\begin{lonelist}
\item \href{https://github.com/arlk/CurveProximityQueries.jl}{CurveProximityQueries.jl}: A Julia package that implements methods to compute proximity queries between parameteric curves or convex bodies in 2/3D.
\item \href{https://github.com/arlk/CurveProximityQueries.jl}{ConvexBodyProximityQueries.jl}: A Julia package that implements methods to compute proximity queries between convex bodies in 2/3D.
\item \href{https://github.com/arlk/cf-firmware}{cf-firmware}: A firmware fork of the original Crazyflie repository that additionally implements geometric control, path following for trajectories, and handles control for attached manipulators.
